# AutoRefresh
This plugin allows users to get Sublime text to reload files in the editor every x seconds (default 3 seconds)
This is useful for monitoring logs which get continuously edited, even while the editor is not in focus.

For example: You are running a fullscreen application and want to view the applications log on a different monitor.
By default, Sublime text will only reload the file once its window comes back into focus. 
AutoRefresh can be used here to automatically reload the file, without having to switch windows.

Usage:
From the commmand palette, use Enable AutoRefresh to enable. Similarly, use Disable AutoRefresh to stop the plugin.
